# User Interface: Info Boxes for VR Builder


## Introduction
This add-on contains a collection of user interface tools, conditions and behaviors for VR Builder. At the moment, it includes the following prefabs, behaviors and condition.

**Info Box**: Mandatory and Optional Infoboxes to guide, teach and inform users. 

**Multiple Choice Box**: Dynamic Multiple Choice UI that can be set up via wizard.  

**Numerical Pad**: Numerical Pad to simulate various user inputs.

**UI Button**: Condition to acknowledge user interactions inside the UI

**UI Outline**: Behavior to guide users inside the UI via outline animations

## Requirements
This add-on requires VR Builder version 4.0.0 or later to work.


## Quick Start
The easiest way to get started with this add-on is to check out the included demo scenes.

There are five demo scenes included in this package:
- InfoBoxDemo
- MultipleChoiceDemo
- NumPadDemo
- UiButtonDemo
- UiOutlineDemo 

If it is the first time you open a demo scene, you will have to do it through the menu: `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > User Interface`. This is necessary as a script will copy the demo courses in the StreamingAssets folder. After the first time, the demo scenes can be opened normally.

Press Play to try out the behaviors and conditions included in this add-on. Each scene contains a demo and set up for a specific use case.
Don't forget to check out the courses for examples on how to use those conditions and behaviors! You can open the Workflow Editor through `Tools > VR Builder > Open Workflow Editor`.

You can find a comprehensive manual in the `Documentation` folder.
